# code-quality-workshop
This workshop aims to spread coding best practices to young developers (interns, < 3y XP ,..). For instance, we could provide exercices about logging or error handling best practices.
Through a real life inspired application, the trainees could deal with coding basics: clean code, OOP principles, TDD and such like (see below) while submitting their first Pull Request. 

They could do it either alone or ( it's strongly recommended) using the pair programming technique.
