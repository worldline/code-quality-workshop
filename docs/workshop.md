# Code quality workshop

## Introduction
This workshop aims to spread coding best practices to young developers (interns, < 3y XP ,..). For instance, we could provide exercices about logging or error handling best practices.
Through a real life inspired application, the trainees could deal with coding basics: clean code, OOP principles, TDD and such like (see below) while submitting their first Pull Reque

During this workshop we will cover:

* OOP principles, SOLID
* Clean code
* Naming
* Classes
* TDD
* Exception/error handling
* Log management
* GIT (conventional commits)
